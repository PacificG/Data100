# Data100

The data science lifecycle involves the following general steps:

1. Question/Problem Formulation:

1. What do we want to know or what problems are we trying to solve?

2. What are our hypotheses?

What are our metrics of success?


Data Acquisition and Cleaning:

What data do we have and what data do we need?

How will we collect more data?

How do we organize the data for analysis?


Exploratory Data Analysis:

Do we already have relevant data?

What are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?

How do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?


Prediction and Inference:

What does the data say about the world?

Does it answer our questions or accurately solve the problem?

How robust are our conclusions?
